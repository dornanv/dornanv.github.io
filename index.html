<h1 style="font-family:verdana;">Veronika Dornan</h1>
<p style="font-family:verdana;">Hello! My name is Veronika, welcome to my webpage. I am a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Edinburgh.
  I'm working in Dr Annette Ferguson's research group as a part of the MARGO (Mining the Archaeological Record in Galaxy Outskirts) project. I'm also a member
  of the Euclid Consortium and the LSST science collaboration.</p>
<h2 style="font-family:verdana;">Research Interests</h2>
<p style="font-family:verdana;">My research is in observing globular cluster systems (GCS) around galaxies,
  specifically studying the GCS mass - halo mass relationship at the highest and lowest mass ends.
  Galaxies across all masses have been found to follow this 1:1 relation, but less is known about where
  brightest cluster galaxies (BCG) and dwarf galaxies fall on it. Studying these galaxies' GCSs can help us understand
  galaxy evolution across all masses and what roles galaxy mergers or disruption could play.</p>
<p style="font-family:verdana;">I am also interested in how we accurately and precisely determine the distributions and populations of
  these massive systems of GCs. How can you accurately determine the mass of a GCS of a galaxy when it
  may seem to overlap with the GCS of its satellites? How do you determine where a GCS ends and the intercluster
  medium begins?</p>

<p style="font-family:verdana;">If you would like to contact me, you can email me at <b>vdornan@ed.ac.uk</b></p>


<h2 style="font-family:verdana;">About Me</h2>
<p style="font-family:verdana;">I'm originally from Ottawa, Ontario but attended Mount Allison University in Sackville, New Brunswick
  for my undergraduate degree. I graduated from Mount Allison in 2019, obtaining a Bsc in honours physics with minors in mathematics and astronomy.
  My honours thesis project was studying models of Delta Scuti varibale stars, supervised by Dr Catherine Lovekin.
  Although Mount Allison is a small university (this may be the first time you're hearing about it!) it has a strong emphasis on interdiciplinary studies,
  which gave me a unique educational foundation in physics. I've studied the ways in which phyiscs relates to women and gender studies, religion,
  literature, and our environment.</p>
<p style="font-family:verdana;">In 2019 I began my graduate studies at McMaster University with Dr Bill Harris, obtaining my Msc in astronomy in 2021 and my PhD in
  astronomy in 2025. McMaster's astronomy department has provided me with amazing opportunities to build my science communication skills and coordinate astronomy
  outreach programs across Ontario (check out the outreach section in the sidebar).</p>
<p style="font-family:verdana;">In my spare time I enjoy playing squash with fellow astronomers in my department, playing
  video games at home, and reading science fiction. Most nights you can find me at the movie theatre, checking out what's on
  and snacking on a large popcorn! When I'm able, I also get out of the city and enjoy exploring the Scottish highlands, and
  taking advantage of this country's wild camping system and  beautiful dark skies!</p>
