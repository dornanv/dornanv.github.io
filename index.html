<p id="DIV">Hello! I am a 4th year Phd student currently supervised by Dr Bill Harris at McMaster University.</p>
<p id="DIV">You can find my orcid profile here: <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7731-1291">see my publications.</a></p>
<h2 id="DIV">Research</h2>
<p id="DIV">My research is in observing globular cluster systems (GCS) around galaxies,
  specifically studying the GCS mass - halo mass relationship at the highest and lowest mass ends.
  Galaxies across all masses have been found to follow this 1:1 relation, but less is known about where
  brightest cluster galaxies (BCG) and dwarfs fall on it. Studying these galaxies' GCSs can help us understand
  galaxy evolution across all masses and what roles mergers could play.</p>
<p id="DIV">I am also interested in how we accurately and precisely determine the distributions and populations of
  these massive systems of GCs. How can you accurately determine the mass of a GCS of a galaxy when it
  may seem to overlap with the GCS of its satellites? How do you determine where a GCS ends and the intercluster
  medium begins?</p>
